Don't Knock Twice is not only a game, but also a movie based on the same urban legend. The movie stars Katee Sackhoff as Jess, a recovered drug addict who tries to reconnect with her daughter Chloe. The movie has some interesting themes about parenthood and addiction, as well as some gruesome scenes that will make you squirm. However, the movie is not very well-known and has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike[^1^] [^2^]. If you are curious about the movie, you can watch it on Netflix or other streaming platforms.
 
As for the game, it is also not very well-received by the gaming community. The game has been criticized for its short length, lack of originality, poor graphics, and boring gameplay. Many reviewers have said that the game is not scary at all, except for some cheap jump scares that are predictable and repetitive[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^]. The game also has some technical issues, such as glitches, bugs, and crashes. The VR mode is supposed to enhance the immersion and the horror, but it also has some drawbacks, such as limited mobility, collision detection problems, and motion sickness.
 
Don't Knock Twice is a game that tries to capitalize on a movie that is not very popular or successful. It is a game that fails to deliver a satisfying horror experience, despite having a promising premise and a creepy setting. It is a game that you can easily skip, unless you are a die-hard fan of the movie or the urban legend. Don't Knock Twice is a game that you don't need to knock twice on.
