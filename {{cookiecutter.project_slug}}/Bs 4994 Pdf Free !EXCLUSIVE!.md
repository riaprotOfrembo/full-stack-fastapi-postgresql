BS 4994:1987 is a British Standard that specifies requirements for the design, materials, construction, inspection, testing and erection of vessels and tanks in reinforced plastics, consisting of a polyester, epoxy or furane resin system reinforced with glass fibres, manufactured by the wet lay-up process[^1^]. It covers vessels and tanks subject to temperatures between -30Â°C and 110Â°C[^2^].

This standard was superseded by BS EN 13923:2005 and BS EN 13121-3:2008+A1:2010, which are European standards for thermoplastic and thermosetting tanks respectively[^1^]. However, some users may still prefer to use BS 4994:1987 for its simplicity and applicability to anisotropic laminar constructions[^2^].

BS 4994:1987 covers various aspects of the design and construction of reinforced plastics vessels and tanks, such as materials selection, design stresses, design loads, design methods, fabrication techniques, inspection and testing procedures, and erection and installation practices. It also provides some guidance on the use and maintenance of these vessels and tanks in service.
 
The standard applies to cylindrical, spherical and rectangular vessels and tanks with capacities up to 300 m3 and diameters up to 6 m. It also covers vessels and tanks with internal or external pressure or vacuum, with or without a thermoplastic lining. It does not apply to vessels and tanks for storing or transporting flammable liquids or gases, or for containing corrosive or toxic substances that may cause environmental damage.
 
BS 4994:1987 is one of the oldest standards for reinforced plastics vessels and tanks in the world. It was first published in 1973 and revised in 1987. It has been widely used and referenced by engineers, designers, manufacturers and users of these products. However, it has also been criticized for being outdated, inconsistent and incomplete in some areas. Therefore, it was replaced by the European standards BS EN 13923:2005 and BS EN 13121-3:2008+A1:2010, which are more comprehensive, harmonized and aligned with the current state of the art.
